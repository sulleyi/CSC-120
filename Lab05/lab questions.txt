Lab Question 3: Write a short description of the internal representation of a board.

Tictactoe_board init:

1. creates an empty list to represent the board
2. checks if the parameter rows needs to be added to the board or if there are None to add
3. If None, then it fills the board with lists of 3 single space chars. Number of lists depends on number of rows the board will have (which is a static variable)
4. Otherwise, an empty row list is created
5. then it loops through each character of each string in the rows parameter, adding each character individually to the row list
6. each row list is then appended to the board list
